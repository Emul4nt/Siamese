# Discord Cloud Drive Bot, aka Siamese

This is a Discord bot that allows you to split files into 10MB segments, send them as messages in a text channel, read messages from a specified channel, and rebuild a file from split messages using a JSON datasbse. Meanwhile, the bot keeps track of the splitting and rebuilding process and stores records of every entry to additionally make the end-users usage simple and efficient.

# Disclaimer

- Don't use this project in a public server, and don't use this storage to upload sensitive data, remember whatever you upload is now at the hands of discord, granted they may have a little but of trouble rebuilding it without the same algorithm, but still.. don't do that.

## Commands

### Split Command

**Syntax:** `!split <file_name>` (Full path to file)
<br>
Example of correct usage: !split /home/username/large_file.exe
Example of incorrect usage: !split ~/large_file.exe

**Description:** This command takes a `file_name` as an argument and splits the file into base64 encoded 2000 character parts. Each part is sent as a separate message in a text channel. A JSON entry is generated and put into `database.json` as well as a copy is pasted into the channel for you to send to others if they need to rebuild from your entry..


### Rebuild Command


**Syntax:** `!rebuild`

**Description:** This command prompts the user to make a selection from the list of entries it has in its `database.json` file and when selected, automatically pulls the messages and decodes them from b64 from the corresponding discord server and channel, and rebuilds the original file.

### List Command

**Syntax:** `!list`

**Description:** This command lists all the available commands in the bot along with their syntax and a brief description of how they work.
